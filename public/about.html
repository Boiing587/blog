    <h1>Hey</h1>
    <p>I'm a 17 year old ICT student with a passion for learning and experimenting with new things, especially programming. The tasks we get in class are too easy, so now I'm taking things into my own hands. This website is a personal project of mine, and is very much work in progress. New changes will come in time.
    <p>For the time being, you can check out my blog, where I post updates whenever we do stuff related to some of the classes we have. You can also change the theme of the page with the buttons in the lower left-hand corner. (it even remembers what theme you last used!)</p>
    <p>I'm brainstorming new ideas to implement on the site, both on the home page, and new pages too. Hang in there.</p>
