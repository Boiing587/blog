    <h1>Hey</h1>
    <p>I'm a 17 year old ICT student with a passion for learning and experimenting with new things, especially programming. The tasks we get in class are too easy, so now I'm taking things into my own hands. This website is a personal project of mine, and is very much work in progress. New changes will come in time.
